scim2-flask
===========

scim2-flask is a :doc:`Flask <flask:index>` :doc:`extension <flask:extensions>` serving a SCIM
2.0 server, as :rfc:`RFC 7643 <7643>` and :rfc:`RFC 7644 <7644>` define it. It exposes the
resource, search, bulk and discovery endpoints. It is built upon
:doc:`scim2-server <scim2_server:index>` and :doc:`scim2-models <scim2_models:index>`.

The extension serves the SCIM protocol. The Flask application that registers it provides the
rest:

- a :class:`~scim2_server.storage.ScimStorage`, which reads and writes the resources;
- a :class:`~scim2_models.ScimProvider`, which declares the resource types the server serves and
  the features it supports;
- authentication and authorization, since the extension leaves every endpoint open.

This documentation addresses Python developers who build a SCIM server with Flask. It assumes
familiarity with Flask applications. It covers what is specific to Flask: the storage, the service
and the protocol rules are described in the :doc:`scim2-server documentation <scim2_server:index>`.
